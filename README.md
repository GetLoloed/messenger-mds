## Proposed Improvements

1. **Push notifications**: Integrate push notifications to notify users about new messages even when the app is not active or in the background.

2. **Media sharing**: Allow users to send and receive media files such as images, videos, and documents.

3. **Audio messages**: Enable users to send and receive voice messages.

4. **End-to-end encryption**: Implement end-to-end encryption to ensure privacy and security of messages exchanged between users.

5. **Group chat**: Implement the ability to create group chats, add/remove participants, and manage group settings.

6. **Read receipts**: Show when a message has been read by the recipient.

7. **Typing indicators**: Display when a user is typing a message in a conversation.

8. **Message search**: Allow users to search for messages within a conversation.

9. **Dark mode**: Add support for a dark theme to reduce eye strain in low-light environments.

10. **User profiles**: Allow users to set profile pictures, update their display names, and add a short bio.

11. **Message reactions**: Enable users to react to messages with emojis.

12. **Message threads**: Allow users to reply to specific messages, creating a thread for better context.

13. **Cloud-based translation**: Integrate a more accurate cloud-based translation API, such as Google Cloud Translation, for better translation results.

14. **Offline mode**: Implement offline support to allow users to send and receive messages when they are not connected to the internet. Messages should be synchronized when the user is back online.

15. **User presence**: Show when users were last online or their current online status.

16. **Blocked users**: Allow users to block and unblock other users, preventing them from sending messages or seeing their online status.
